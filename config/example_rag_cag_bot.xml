    <attack>
      <prompt>Let's start with credential dumping attacks. What are the main techniques used by attackers to steal credentials from Windows systems?</prompt>
      <system_prompt>You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in credential access attacks. Focus on providing detailed technical explanations about credential dumping techniques, tools like Mimikatz, and defensive strategies.</system_prompt>
      <quiz>
        <question>What is the primary mechanism that Mimikatz uses to extract credentials from Windows systems?</question>
        <answer>LSASS memory access</answer>
        <correct_answer_response>Correct! Mimikatz primarily accesses the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory to extract credential material. This technique is classified as T1003.001 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.</correct_answer_response>
      </quiz>
      <condition>
        <output_matches>LSASS|Local Security Authority</output_matches>
        <message>Excellent! You've identified the key component. LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is indeed the primary target for credential dumping attacks.</message>
      </condition>
      <else_condition>
        <message>Consider exploring Windows credential storage mechanisms and the LSASS process. Try using the knowledge base to learn more about credential access techniques.</message>
      </else_condition>
    </attack>

    <attack>
      <prompt>Now let's examine phishing attacks. How can you identify a sophisticated phishing email, and what defensive measures are most effective against spear phishing?</prompt>
      <system_prompt>You are a social engineering and phishing defense expert. Provide detailed explanations about phishing techniques, email analysis, and defensive strategies including email filtering and user awareness training.</system_prompt>
      <quiz>
        <question>What is the primary defense mechanism against zero-day phishing attacks that bypass traditional email filters?</question>
        <answer>user awareness training</answer>
        <correct_answer_response>Correct! User awareness training is the primary defense against zero-day phishing attacks. Even sophisticated email filtering can be bypassed by novel phishing techniques, making educated users the last line of defense.</correct_answer_response>
      </quiz>
      <condition>
        <output_matches>spear phishing|targeted|whaling</output_matches>
        <message>Great insight! You're recognizing the sophistication of targeted attacks. These are often more dangerous than broad phishing campaigns.</message>
      </condition>
      <else_condition>
        <message>Consider exploring different types of phishing attacks and their specific characteristics. The knowledge base contains detailed information about various phishing techniques.</message>
      </else_condition>
    </attack>

    <attack>
      <prompt>Let's analyze ransomware defense strategies. What are the three critical components of an effective ransomware defense program?</prompt>
      <system_prompt>You are a ransomware defense and incident response expert. Focus on providing comprehensive information about ransomware families, attack vectors, and multi-layered defense strategies.</system_prompt>
      <quiz>
        <question>Which backup strategy is most effective against ransomware that encrypts network shares?</question>
        <answer>3-2-1 backup rule</answer>
        <correct_answer_response>Excellent! The 3-2-1 backup rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite) is the most effective strategy against ransomware. This ensures that even if network shares are encrypted, you have recoverable backups.</correct_answer_response>
      </quiz>
      <condition>
        <output_matches>backup|recovery|immutable</output_matches>
        <message>Excellent focus! Backup and recovery are indeed critical components of ransomware defense. Immutable backups are particularly important as they cannot be encrypted or deleted by attackers.</message>
      </condition>
      <else_condition>
        <message>Consider the multiple layers of ransomware defense: prevention, detection, response, and recovery. The knowledge base has detailed information about ransomware families and defense strategies.</message>
      </else_condition>
    </attack>

    <attack>
      <prompt>Finally, let's explore network security monitoring. What are the key indicators of compromise (IOCs) that suggest an active network intrusion?</prompt>
      <system_prompt>You are a network security monitoring and threat hunting expert. Provide detailed explanations about network intrusion detection, traffic analysis, and threat hunting methodologies.</system_prompt>
      <quiz>
        <question>What network protocol behavior often indicates C2 (Command and Control) communication?</question>
        <answer>beaconing|periodic communication|dns tunneling</answer>
        <correct_answer_response>Correct! Beaconing behavior - periodic, regular communication from internal systems to external IP addresses - is a classic indicator of C2 communication. Other patterns include DNS tunneling and unusual protocol usage.</correct_answer_response>
      </quiz>
      <condition>
        <output_matches>C2|command and control|beaconing|anomaly</output_matches>
        <message>Great observation! You're identifying key behavioral patterns that indicate advanced persistent threats. These are exactly the types of IOCs that security analysts look for during threat hunting.</message>
      </condition>
      <else_condition>
        <message>Consider exploring network traffic analysis techniques and common patterns of malicious network activity. The knowledge base contains information about various attack tools and their network behaviors.</message>
