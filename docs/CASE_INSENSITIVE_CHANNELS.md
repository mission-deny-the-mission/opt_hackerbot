# Case-Insensitive Channel Handling Fix

## Overview

The IRC server has been updated to properly handle channel names in a case-insensitive manner, which is required by the IRC protocol standards (RFC 1459, RFC 2812).

## Problem

Previously, the IRC server treated channel names as case-sensitive, which caused issues when:
- Users tried to join channels with different capitalization
- Messages were sent to channels with mismatched case
- Commands like LIST, NAMES, and PART failed due to case differences

## Solution

The fix implements proper case-insensitive channel handling by:

1. **Channel Storage**: Channel names are stored in lowercase in the `channels` dictionary for consistent lookups
2. **Canonical Name Mapping**: A separate `channel_names` dictionary maps lowercase names to their original case for display purposes
3. **Case Conversion**: All channel operations convert names to lowercase for storage and lookup
4. **Display Preservation**: The original case is preserved for all user-facing messages

## Changes Made

### Data Structures
```python
# Before
channels = {"#hackerbot": set()}

# After
channels = {"#hackerbot": set()}  # Keys are lowercase for case-insensitive lookup
channel_names = {"#hackerbot": "#hackerbot"}  # Maps lowercase to original case
```

### Key Functions Updated

1. **join_channel()**: 
   - Converts channel name to lowercase for storage
   - Preserves original case for display
   - Creates new channels with proper case mapping

2. **part_channel()**:
   - Uses lowercase lookup for channel operations
   - Displays original case in messages
   - Cleans up empty channels and mappings

3. **PRIVMSG handling**:
   - Converts target to lowercase for lookup
   - Uses canonical name for message display
   - Properly handles "no such channel" errors

4. **LIST command**:
   - Shows channels with their original case
   - Maintains proper user counts

5. **NAMES command**:
   - Case-insensitive channel lookup
   - Displays canonical channel names

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test/test_case_insensitive_channels.py`) verifies:

- ✓ Joining channels with capital letters (#TestChannel)
- ✓ Sending messages using different case (#testchannel)
- ✓ Duplicate join prevention with case variants
- ✓ LIST command showing correct case
- ✓ NAMES command working case-insensitively
- ✓ PART command working case-insensitively

## Usage Examples

All of these now work correctly and refer to the same channel:

```irc
JOIN #TestChannel
PRIVMSG #testchannel :Hello World!
NAMES #TESTCHANNEL
PART #TestChannel
LIST
```

## Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing lowercase channels continue to work unchanged
- All IRC clients will work correctly
- Default #hackerbot channel remains unchanged
- Protocol compliance is improved

## RFC Compliance

This implementation aligns with IRC protocol standards:
- RFC 1459: Channel names are case-insensitive
- RFC 2812: Case-insensitive comparisons for channel names
- Modern IRC servers all implement case-insensitive channel handling

## Testing the Fix

To test the fix:

1. Start the IRC server:
   ```bash
   cd /home/harry/opt_hackerbot
   python3 simple_irc_server.py
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python3 test/test_case_insensitive_channels.py
   ```

3. Or test manually with any IRC client:
   ```irc
   /connect 127.0.0.1 6667
   /nick TestUser
   /join #TestChannel
   /privmsg #testchannel :Hello from test!
   /names #TESTCHANNEL
   /part #TestChannel
   /list
   ```

The IRC server now properly handles channels with capital letters while maintaining full IRC protocol compliance.
