nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Appropriate for IRC bot use case. Message history in-memory only. No vulnerabilities identified. Configurable filtering supports privacy."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient implementation with bounded memory usage. Configurable history windows prevent unbounded growth. O(n) context assembly where n is limited."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling and backward compatibility maintained. Graceful fallback to traditional history format. Pruning mechanisms prevent resource exhaustion."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with excellent test coverage. Well-documented methods. Good separation of concerns. Follows Ruby best practices."
