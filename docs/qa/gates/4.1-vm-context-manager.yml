nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minor: file_path parameter in read_file uses string interpolation. Acceptable for training environment but could add sanitization for production hardening. Follows existing bot_manager.rb patterns."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient non-blocking I/O pattern, proper timeout handling, graceful degradation on errors"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, timeout management, graceful degradation. Returns nil or empty strings on errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with @param/@return/@example tags, clear method names, follows Ruby conventions, well-structured class hierarchy"
