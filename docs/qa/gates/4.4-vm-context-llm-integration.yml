nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "VM context properly formatted and isolated in prompt sections. Error handling prevents context leakage on failures. No security issues identified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "VM context fetching integrated efficiently into existing get_enhanced_context flow. Context length management properly implemented with truncation strategies. No performance degradation observed."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation. VM context fetch failures are caught and logged, system continues without VM context. Proper initialization checks in place."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean integration with existing prompt assembly system. Well-documented methods with clear parameter descriptions. Configuration flags properly parsed and respected. Code follows Ruby conventions and project standards."
