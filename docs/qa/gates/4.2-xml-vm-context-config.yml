nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Configuration parsing from trusted XML files. No security concerns. Path/command validation handled by VMContextManager (Story 4.1)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient Nokogiri-based parsing. Only occurs during configuration load time, not runtime. Minimal memory footprint."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for empty/missing elements. Proper validation of attributes (e.g., limit > 0). Graceful handling of edge cases."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality following parse_context_config pattern for consistency. Clear method structure. Well-integrated into existing architecture. Comprehensive test coverage ensures maintainability."

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider simplifying the empty element check logic (lines 1859-1864) in future refactoring if desired. Current implementation is acceptable as defensive programming."
