# Incident Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive incident response procedures designed to help organizations effectively detect, contain, and remediate security incidents. A well-structured incident response plan is essential for minimizing damage, reducing recovery time, and maintaining business continuity.

## Incident Response Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Preparation

#### Team Structure
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: Cross-functional team responsible for handling incidents
- **Incident Commander**: Overall coordination and decision-making authority
- **Technical Lead**: Manages technical aspects of incident investigation and remediation
- **Communications Lead**: Handles internal and external communications
- **Legal/Compliance Advisor**: Ensures legal and regulatory compliance

#### Tools and Resources
- **Incident Response Platform**: Centralized ticketing and workflow management
- **Forensic Tools**: Hardware and software for evidence collection and analysis
- **Communication Channels**: Secure channels for team coordination (Signal, encrypted chat)
- **Documentation Repository**: Centralized storage for incident documentation and playbooks

#### Training and Exercises
- Quarterly incident response simulations
- Tabletop exercises for major incident scenarios
- Technical training on forensic tools and techniques
- Cross-team coordination drills

### Phase 2: Detection and Analysis

#### Monitoring and Detection
- **SIEM Alerts**: Real-time correlation of security events
- **Endpoint Detection**: Monitor for malware, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration
- **Network Monitoring**: Track unusual traffic patterns and connections
- **User Behavior Analytics**: Identify anomalous user activities

#### Incident Triage
1. **Initial Assessment**: Determine if the event constitutes a security incident
2. **Severity Classification**: Rate incidents based on potential impact
3. **Priority Assignment**: Establish response timelines based on severity
4. **Resource Allocation**: Assign appropriate team members and resources

#### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to life safety or critical infrastructure
- **High**: Significant data breach or system compromise
- **Medium**: Limited security incident with contained impact
- **Low**: Minor security event with minimal impact

### Phase 3: Containment

#### Immediate Containment Actions
- **Isolate Affected Systems**: Disconnect from network or place in quarantine VLAN
- **Block Malicious IPs/Domain**: Update firewall and security device rules
- **Disable Compromised Accounts**: Suspend user accounts involved in the incident
- **Preserve Evidence: Create forensic images before making changes**

#### Containment Strategies
- **Network Containment**: Use firewall rules and network segmentation
- **Host Containment**: Isolate individual workstations or servers
- **Account Containment**: Disable or reset compromised credentials
- **Data Containment**: Prevent data exfiltration and protect sensitive information

### Phase 4: Investigation

#### Evidence Collection
- **Memory Forensics**: Capture RAM contents from affected systems
- **Disk Imaging**: Create bit-for-bit copies of storage media
- **Network Logs**: Collect firewall, IDS/IPS, and proxy logs
- **System Logs**: Gather Windows Event Logs, Linux syslogs, application logs
- **Malware Analysis**: Isolate and analyze suspicious files

#### Timeline Reconstruction
```bash
# Example timeline analysis commands
# Windows events
wevtutil qe Security /f:text | grep "Event ID 4624"

# Linux authentication logs
grep "ssh" /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted"

# Network connections
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

# Process information
ps aux | grep -v "^[ ]*root"
```

#### Attack Vector Analysis
- **Initial Access**: Determine how attackers gained entry
- **Lateral Movement**: Track how attackers moved through the network
- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Identify backdoors and persistence techniques
- **Data Exfiltration**: Determine if and how data was stolen

### Phase 5: Eradication

#### Threat Elimination
- **Malware Removal**: Clean or reimage infected systems
- **Backdoor Elimination**: Remove unauthorized access methods
- **Credential Reset**: Change all potentially compromised passwords
- **Configuration Review**: Audit and harden system configurations

#### Vulnerability Patching
- **Security Updates**: Apply all relevant security patches
- **Configuration Changes**: Implement security hardening measures
- **Access Control Review**: Update permissions and access rights
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement additional controls to prevent recurrence

### Phase 6: Recovery

#### System Restoration
- **Clean Restoration**: Restore systems from known-good backups
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure restored systems meet security standards
- **Functionality Testing**: Verify systems operate as expected
- **Security Verification**: Confirm all security controls are functioning

#### Monitoring Enhancement
- **Enhanced Detection**: Implement additional monitoring for recurrence
- **Alert Tuning**: Adjust SIEM rules based on incident findings
- **Logging Improvements**: Increase log collection and retention
- **Security Controls**: Add preventive measures based on lessons learned

### Phase 7: Post-Incident Activities

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Incident Timeline**: Detailed chronology of events and actions
- **Impact Assessment**: Business and technical impact analysis
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying vulnerabilities and process failures
- **Lessons Learned**: Document improvements needed for future incidents

#### Reporting Structure
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview for leadership
- **Technical Report**: Detailed findings for technical teams
- **Legal Documentation**: Compliance and regulatory reporting
- **Action Items**: Specific recommendations and improvement plans

#### Communication Protocols
- **Internal Communications**: Updates to employees and stakeholders
- **External Communications**: Customer notifications and PR statements
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Mandatory breach notifications to authorities
- **Law Enforcement Coordination**: When and how to involve law enforcement

## Incident Types and Procedures

### Ransomware Incidents
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect affected systems from network
2. **Evidence Preservation**: Capture memory and disk images before cleanup
3. **Backup Assessment**: Determine if clean backups are available
4. **Decision Point**: Evaluate whether to pay ransom (not recommended)
5. **Recovery Planning**: Restore systems from clean backups

### Data Breach Incidents
1. **Scope Assessment**: Determine what data was compromised
2. **Legal Notification**: Consult legal counsel for notification requirements
3. **Customer Communication**: Prepare breach notification to affected parties
4. **Credit Monitoring**: Offer identity protection services to affected individuals
5. **Regulatory Reporting**: File required reports with relevant authorities

### Phishing and Account Compromise
1. **Account Suspension**: Immediately disable compromised accounts
2. **Password Resets**: Force password changes for potentially affected accounts
3. **Email Analysis**: Examine email headers and content for attacker TTPs
4. **User Training**: Provide targeted security awareness training
5. **Email Security**: Enhance email filtering and security controls

### Denial of Service Attacks
1. **Traffic Analysis**: Identify attack patterns and source IP addresses
2. **Mitigation Activation**: Engage DDoS protection services
3. **ISP Coordination**: Work with internet service provider to block attack traffic
4. **Service Continuity**: Implement failover to backup systems if available
5. **Post-Attack Review**: Analyze attack methods and improve defenses
