- [ ] **Task 6.4: Example Report Section**
  ```markdown
  ## Query Latency Comparison

  | Metric | RAG | CAG | Improvement | Winner |
  |--------|-----|-----|-------------|--------|
  | Mean | 1200ms | 480ms | 60% faster | CAG |
  | Median | 1000ms | 400ms | 60% faster | CAG |
  | P95 | 2500ms | 800ms | 68% faster | CAG |
  | P99 | 3200ms | 1200ms | 62.5% faster | CAG |

  **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.001 (highly significant)

  **Analysis**: CAG demonstrates 60% faster query latency on average, meeting
  the target improvement range (50-80%). The improvement is consistent across
  all percentiles and statistically significant.

  ### Latency Breakdown

  **CAG Average**:
  - Cache lookup: 50ms (10%)
  - Context assembly: 100ms (21%)
  - Response generation: 330ms (69%)

  **RAG Average**:
  - Vector search: 400ms (33%)
  - Context assembly: 200ms (17%)
  - Response generation: 600ms (50%)

  **Key Finding**: CAG eliminates expensive vector search, reducing overall
  latency. Pre-cached context also reduces response generation time.

  ## Architectural Recommendation

  **Recommendation**: Implement Hybrid CAG-RAG system with intelligent routing.

  **Rationale**:
  - CAG demonstrates 65% faster query latency (meets target)
  - CAG maintains comparable relevance scores (8.1/10 vs RAG 8.2/10)
  - CAG memory overhead acceptable (+30% vs RAG, within 6GB limit)
  - Different systems excel at different query types

  **Hybrid Routing Strategy**:
  - Use CAG for: Frequent queries, tool/command lookups, concept definitions
  - Use RAG for: Complex multi-concept queries, rare/novel queries, dynamic knowledge
  - Route based on: Query complexity, cache hit probability, context size

  **Trade-offs Accepted**:
  - Increased system complexity (managing two systems)
  - Higher total memory usage (both caches in memory)
  - Additional routing logic and maintenance

  **Performance Gains**:
  - Average latency reduction: 45% (hybrid) vs RAG-only
  - Cache hit rate: 70% of queries benefit from CAG speed
  - Relevance maintained or improved

  **Next Steps**:
  - Implement hybrid routing manager (Story 2.9)
  - Define routing heuristics based on query characteristics
  - Create configuration options for routing preferences
  - Update documentation with usage guidelines

  - [ ] **IV1**: Verify no production data modified
  - [ ] **IV2**: Verify tests run unattended without manual intervention
  - [ ] **IV3**: Verify results reproducible across runs (variance < 10%)

## Dev Notes

### Performance Testing Strategy

**Goal**: Provide quantitative data comparing CAG vs RAG systems to validate CAG performance improvements and inform architectural decisions.

**Target Validation**: Confirm CAG achieves 50-80% latency reduction vs RAG while maintaining comparable relevance scores.

**Fair Comparison Principles**:
- Same knowledge base for both systems
- Same query set for both systems (100+ queries from Story 1.2)
- Same hardware and environment
- Measure only CAG/RAG performance (exclude LLM inference)
- Isolate variables (test one thing at a time)
- Run tests multiple times to ensure reproducibility

[Source: Epic 2 success criteria, docs/prd.md]

### CAG-Specific Metrics

**KV Cache Efficiency**:
- Cache hit rate: % of queries answered from pre-loaded cache
- Cache utilization: % of cache capacity actively used
- Cache eviction rate: How often cache needs to be refreshed
- Precomputation time: Time to build KV cache for knowledge base

**Cache Performance Breakdown**:
```
Query Latency = Cache Lookup + Context Assembly + Response Generation

Cache Lookup: Time to find relevant context in KV cache
Context Assembly: Time to format cached context for LLM
Response Generation: Time for LLM to generate response (may be faster with pre-cached KV)
```

**Comparison to RAG**:
```
RAG Query Latency = Vector Search + Context Assembly + Response Generation

Vector Search: Time for similarity search (CAG eliminates this)
Context Assembly: Time to format retrieved docs (may be slower than CAG)
Response Generation: Time for LLM to generate response
```

### Target Performance Metrics

**From PRD NFRs**:
- CAG query latency: ≤ 2 seconds (NFR10)
- CAG memory usage: ≤ 6GB for 1000+ documents (NFR8)
- CAG cache precomputation: ≤ 5 minutes (NFR9)
- Latency improvement target: 50-80% reduction vs RAG (FR9)

**Success Criteria**:
- Primary: 50-80% latency reduction achieved
- Secondary: Relevance scores within 10% of RAG
- Tertiary: Memory usage within NFR limits

[Source: docs/prd.md#2.2 Non-Functional Requirements]

### Query Categories and Expected Performance

**Expected CAG Advantages**:
- Simple tool/command queries (cache hit likely)
- Concept definition queries (well-defined in knowledge base)
- Frequently asked questions (high cache efficiency)

**Expected RAG Advantages**:
- Novel/rare queries (outside common cache patterns)
- Complex multi-concept queries (may require dynamic retrieval)
- Queries requiring latest/dynamic knowledge

**Neutral Categories**:
- MITRE ATT&CK technique queries (both systems should perform well)
- General cybersecurity concepts (depends on query complexity)

### Memory Measurement for CAG

**CAG Memory Components**:
- Knowledge base cache (preprocessed documents)
- KV cache (attention parameters for pre-loaded context)
- Context manager overhead
- Runtime query processing

**Measurement Approach**:
```ruby
def measure_cag_memory_breakdown
  baseline = get_memory_usage

  cag_manager.load_knowledge_base
  after_kb = get_memory_usage

  cag_manager.precompute_kv_cache
  after_kv = get_memory_usage

  {
    baseline_mb: baseline / 1024.0 / 1024.0,
    knowledge_base_mb: (after_kb - baseline) / 1024.0 / 1024.0,
    kv_cache_mb: (after_kv - after_kb) / 1024.0 / 1024.0,
    total_mb: after_kv / 1024.0 / 1024.0
  }
end
```

### Statistical Significance Testing

**Sample Size**: 100+ queries per system = 200+ total executions provides strong statistical power

**Significance Tests**:
- Paired t-test for latency comparison (same query on both systems)
- Mann-Whitney U test if distributions non-normal
- Effect size calculation (Cohen's d) to quantify improvement magnitude
- Confidence intervals (95%) for all metrics

**Practical Significance**:
- Report both statistical and practical significance
- Focus on real-world impact: "60% faster = 600ms saved per query"
- Consider use case relevance: "For interactive training, <1s response critical"

### Report Output Formats

**Primary Report**: Markdown (test/results/cag_vs_rag_performance_report.md)
- Human-readable comparison
- Can be committed to repo
- Easy to review in pull requests
- Contains charts, tables, and analysis

**Supporting Data**: CSV or JSON (test/results/cag_rag_comparison_data.csv)
- Raw data for both systems
- Can import into spreadsheet or R/Python if needed
- Enables reproducibility and further analysis
- Includes per-query breakdown

**Visualizations**: ASCII charts in Markdown OR data export
- Side-by-side latency distribution charts
- Memory usage comparison bars
- Cache efficiency metrics (CAG-specific)
- Use terminal-table gem or similar for ASCII tables

### Optimization Strategy

**Iterative Approach**:
1. Run baseline performance tests
2. Identify top 3 bottlenecks from data
3. Implement targeted optimizations
4. Re-run tests to validate improvements
5. Document optimization impact
6. Repeat if time allows

**Optimization Priorities**:
1. **High Impact**: Optimizations that improve latency by >20%
2. **Medium Impact**: Optimizations that improve latency by 10-20%
3. **Low Impact**: Optimizations that improve latency by <10%

**Optimization Examples**:
- Batch KV cache precomputation
- Cache warming for common queries
- Lazy loading for large knowledge bases
- Context assembly optimization
- Memory pool for cache management

### Time Considerations

**Long-Running Test**: 100+ queries × 2 systems = 200+ query executions

**Estimated Time**:
- If average query takes 0.5-1.5 seconds: 2-5 minutes for queries only
- Plus loading time for both systems: +2-3 minutes
- Plus KV cache precomputation: +1-2 minutes
- Total: 10-15 minutes for full test suite
- May exceed 5-minute test suite target (acceptable for this performance story)

**Optimization**:
- Cache knowledge base loading between query batches
- Provide progress indicators
- Consider parallel execution if feasible (isolate test runs)
- Run multiple test iterations overnight if needed

### Integration with Story 1.2 (RAG Performance)

**Reuse Components**:
- Query set from test/fixtures/performance_queries.yaml
- Performance metrics collection framework
- Statistical analysis utilities
- Relevance scoring rubric
- Report generation templates

**Extensions for CAG**:
- Add KV cache efficiency metrics
- Add cache hit/miss tracking
- Extend latency breakdown for cache operations
- Add CAG-specific memory measurements
- Extend reports for comparative analysis
