## Epic Goal

Implement a Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) system from scratch to provide an alternative knowledge enhancement approach, enabling faster query responses and reduced system complexity for cybersecurity training use cases.

---

## Epic Description

### Background and Context

**Why Implement CAG Now?**
Based on Epic 1 findings, the RAG system has been validated as production-ready. However, CAG offers compelling advantages for specific use cases:
- **Reduced Latency**: Eliminates real-time vector similarity search
- **Lower Complexity**: No vector database management required
- **Consistent Performance**: Pre-computed KV caches ensure predictable response times
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced computational overhead during inference

**CAG System Overview**

Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) is an alternative to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that preloads all relevant knowledge into a long-context LLM's KV cache, enabling direct response generation without real-time document retrieval.

**Key CAG Characteristics**:
- **Preloading Phase**: All knowledge base documents loaded into model context
- **KV Cache Computation**: Model processes and caches attention parameters
- **Inference Phase**: Direct generation using cached context
- **Cache Reset**: Clear cache for knowledge base updates

**Technical Architecture**

**Core Components**:
1. **Knowledge Base Loader**: Load and prepare documents for CAG context
2. **Context Manager**: Manage document assembly and context window optimization
3. **Cache Manager**: Handle KV cache precomputation and storage
4. **Inference Engine**: Generate responses using cached context
5. **Knowledge Base Updater**: Handle cache invalidation and refresh

**Integration Points**:
- knowledge_bases/sources/ - Shared knowledge source loading
- LLM clients (Ollama, OpenAI) - For long-context models
- bot_manager.rb - IRC bot integration with CAG context
- RAG system - Coexistence and fallback option
