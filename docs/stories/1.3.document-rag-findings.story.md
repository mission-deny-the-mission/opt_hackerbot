- [ ] **Task 3.4: Example Decision Section**
  ```markdown
  ## Architectural Decision

  **Decision**: Proceed with **RAG-only** approach for production deployment.

  **Decision Date**: 2025-10-XX

  **Rationale**:

  1. **Relevance**: RAG achieved 8.2/10 average relevance score vs CAG's 6.5/10
     - Critical for educational context where accuracy matters
     - Vector similarity search better handles semantic queries

  2. **Acceptable Performance**: RAG query latency <2s (p95) meets NFR4 requirement
     - User experience acceptable for IRC bot interaction
     - CAG speed advantage (33% faster) not critical for use case

  3. **Implementation Complexity**: RAG implementation mature and stable
     - CAG required significant reimplementation effort (Story 1.2)
     - Solo developer maintainability favors simpler approach

  4. **Dynamic Knowledge**: RAG better supports knowledge base updates
     - Can add new documents without cache rebuilding
     - Important for evolving cybersecurity content

  **Trade-offs Accepted**:
  - 30-40% slower query latency than CAG
  - Higher memory usage during operation (3.2GB vs 2.1GB)
  - Dependency on vector database (ChromaDB)

  **Alternatives Considered**:
  - CAG-only: Rejected due to relevance concerns and implementation complexity
  - Hybrid RAG+CAG: Rejected due to added complexity without clear benefit
  ```

  - [x] Document offline operation limitations (Ollama requirement)
  - [x] Document knowledge base size limits (~2,000 documents estimated)

- [ ] **Task 4.4: Example Issues Section**
  ```markdown
  ## Known Issues and Limitations

  ### RAG System Issues

  **Issue 1**: Large document handling
  - **Description**: Documents >10,000 words cause chunking delays
  - **Severity**: Low
  - **Workaround**: Pre-process large documents into smaller sections
  - **Tracked**: N/A (design limitation)

  ### System Limitations

  **Limitation 1**: Knowledge base size
  - **Current**: Tested up to 1,000 documents
  - **Limit**: ~2,000 documents before memory exceeds 4GB
  - **Impact**: May need optimization for very large knowledge bases

  **Limitation 2**: Embedding model dependency
  - **Current**: Requires Ollama or OpenAI for embeddings
  - **Impact**: Cannot operate fully offline without Ollama installed
  - **Mitigation**: Document Ollama as required dependency

  ### CAG Status

  **Status**: Not production-ready (as of Epic 1 completion)

  **Issues Identified**:
  - Document loading failures (Story 1.1)
  - Knowledge graph complexity vs benefit trade-off (Story 1.2)
  - Lower relevance scores in testing (Story 1.5)

  **Future Work**: CAG deferred for potential future reimplementation with simpler caching approach.

- [ ] **Task 5.3: Example Optimization Section**
  ```markdown
  ## Optimization Recommendations

  ### Priority 1: High Impact, Low Effort

  **Opt-1: Implement Query Result Caching**
  - **Impact**: 50-80% latency reduction for repeated queries
  - **Effort**: 1-2 days
  - **Details**: Cache RAG results for identical queries, TTL 1 hour
  - **Benefits**: Significant speedup for common student questions

  **Opt-2: Tune ChromaDB Collection Parameters**
  - **Impact**: 10-20% latency reduction
  - **Effort**: 0.5 days
  - **Details**: Optimize HNSW index parameters for our query patterns
  - **Benefits**: Faster similarity search

  ### Priority 2: Medium Impact, Medium Effort

  **Opt-3: Implement Document Chunking Strategy**
  - **Impact**: Improved relevance for large documents
  - **Effort**: 2-3 days
  - **Details**: Smart chunking with overlap, preserve context
  - **Benefits**: Better results from man pages and long lab sheets

  ### Priority 3: Long-term Improvements

  **Opt-4: Explore Alternative Embedding Models**
  - **Impact**: Potentially better relevance, faster embeddings
  - **Effort**: 1 week (research + testing)
  - **Details**: Test smaller, faster embedding models
  - **Benefits**: Reduced latency, lower resource usage
  ```

### Phase 6: Document SecGen Integration Considerations (AC: 6)

  - [x] Document automatic vs manual knowledge population (auto with MITRE/man pages)
  - [x] Address offline operation for generated VMs (pre-load embeddings, Ollama in VM)
  - [x] Consider knowledge base customization per scenario (difficulty-based filtering)

- [ ] **Task 6.4: Example SecGen Section**
  ```markdown
  ## SecGen Integration Considerations

  ### Integration Architecture

  **Chosen Approach**: RAG-only with SecGen-generated knowledge bases

  **Integration Points**:
  1. SecGen scenario generator → Hackerbot knowledge base loader
  2. Generated lab sheets (markdown) → RAG document ingestion
  3. Per-scenario bot configuration → RAG collection selection

  ### Integration Requirements

  **Req-1**: SecGen must generate structured markdown lab sheets
  - Format: Defined markdown schema for RAG parsing
  - Metadata: Include lab ID, difficulty, topics
  - Storage: knowledge_bases/secgen_labs/ directory

  **Req-2**: Hackerbot must support dynamic knowledge base loading
  - Load lab sheets at scenario initialization
  - Create scenario-specific RAG collections
  - Support multiple concurrent scenarios

  **Req-3**: Offline operation for generated VMs
  - Pre-load embeddings during VM generation
  - Include Ollama in VM image
  - No external API dependencies

  ### Knowledge Base Strategy

  **Automatic Population**:
  - SecGen generates lab markdown → auto-loaded into RAG
  - MITRE ATT&CK pre-loaded in base image
  - System man pages auto-indexed

  **Customization**:
  - Per-scenario knowledge scope filtering
  - Lab-specific hints and solutions stored separately
  - Difficulty-based knowledge availability

  ### Integration Effort Estimate

  **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks
  - SecGen markdown generator: 3-5 days
  - Hackerbot dynamic loading: 2-3 days
  - Integration testing: 2-3 days
  - Documentation: 1 day

### Writing Style Guidelines

**Clarity**: Write for future developers who weren't involved in Epic 1
**Precision**: Use specific numbers and references, not vague statements
**Honesty**: Document limitations and trade-offs transparently
**Actionability**: Recommendations should be concrete and implementable

**Example - Vague (Bad)**:
> "RAG performs well enough for our needs."

**Example - Specific (Good)**:
> "RAG achieves p95 latency of 1.8s, meeting the NFR4 requirement of ≤5s. While CAG is 35% faster, RAG's superior relevance scores (8.2/10 vs 6.5/10) make it the better choice for educational use cases."
