## Dev Notes

### RAG System Architecture

**RAG Manager** (`rag/rag_manager.rb`):
- Main coordinator for RAG operations
- Methods to test: `get_relevant_documents`, `add_documents`, `search`, context formatting
- [Source: docs/development/architecture.md#245-261]

**Vector DB Interface** (`rag/vector_db_interface.rb`):
- Abstract interface for vector database operations
- Implementations: ChromaDB (in-memory and server-based)
- [Source: Codebase inspection]

**Embedding Service Interface** (`rag/embedding_service_interface.rb`):
- Abstract interface for embedding generation
- Implementations: OpenAI, Ollama
- [Source: Codebase inspection]

### Existing Test Patterns

**Test Framework**: Ruby Minitest (based on existing tests)
[Source: test/test_helper.rb, test/test_llm_client_base.rb]

**Test File Pattern**:
```ruby
require_relative 'test_helper'

class TestRAGComprehensive < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    # Initialize test RAG manager
  end

  def teardown
    # Clean up test resources
  end

  def test_something
    # Test implementation
  end
end
```

**Test Execution**:
```bash
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb
# or
ruby test/run_tests.rb  # Run all tests
```
[Source: Existing test files]

### Test Configuration Example

```ruby
def setup
  @rag_config = {
    vector_db: {
      provider: 'chromadb',
      mode: 'in_memory'  # Isolated from production
    },
    embedding_service: {
      provider: 'ollama',
      model: 'nomic-embed-text'  # Small, fast model for testing
    },
    collection_name: 'test_rag_collection'  # Separate from production
  }

  @rag_manager = RAGManager.new(@rag_config)
end

def teardown
  @rag_manager.cleanup if @rag_manager
end
```

### Knowledge Source Test Data

**MITRE ATT&CK Sample**:
```ruby
# Small subset of techniques for testing
test_attack_data = [
  {
    id: 'T1003',
    name: 'Credential Dumping',
    description: 'Tools and techniques for dumping credentials...',
    metadata: { tactic: 'credential-access' }
  },
  # ... more test data
]
```

**Man Page Sample**:
```
LS(1)                     User Commands                    LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
...
```

**Markdown Sample**:
```markdown
# Lab 1: Port Scanning

## Objective
Learn to use nmap for network reconnaissance.

## Tools
- nmap
- netstat
...
```

### Performance Benchmarks

**Target Metrics** (from NFR4):
- Query response time: â‰¤ 5 seconds (excluding LLM inference)
- Document loading: â‰¤ 60 seconds for typical knowledge base
- Memory usage: â‰¤ 4GB for 1000+ documents

[Source: docs/prd.md#2.2 Non-Functional Requirements]

### Offline Testing

**CRITICAL**: Tests must pass without external network access

- Use Ollama for local embeddings (or mock embeddings)
- Use ChromaDB in-memory mode
- No OpenAI API calls in core tests
- Network tests should be optional/skipped in offline mode

[Source: docs/prd.md#2.3 CR4: Offline Operation Compatibility]

### Error Handling Pattern

```ruby
def test_error_scenario
  assert_raises(SomeError) do
    @rag_manager.method_that_should_fail
  end
end

def test_graceful_degradation
  result = @rag_manager.search_with_failures
  assert_nil result  # Should return nil, not crash
end
```

### Coverage Measurement

If using SimpleCov:
```ruby
# In test_helper.rb or top of test file
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start do
  add_filter '/test/'
  add_group 'RAG System', 'rag/'
end
```

## Testing

### Testing Strategy for This Story

**This IS the testing story** - we're creating tests, not testing tests.

**Validation Approach**:
1. **Manual Verification**: Run test suite, verify all pass
2. **Coverage Check**: Measure code coverage, verify >80%
3. **Performance Check**: Measure test execution time, verify <5 minutes
4. **Offline Check**: Run tests without network, verify pass

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run RAG comprehensive tests
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb

# Run with verbose output
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb --verbose

# Run in Nix environment
nix develop
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb

# Run all tests (optional)
ruby test/run_tests.rb
```

### Success Criteria

âœ… All tests pass
âœ… >80% code coverage on RAG manager
âœ… Tests complete in <5 minutes
âœ… Tests pass offline
âœ… No production data modified
