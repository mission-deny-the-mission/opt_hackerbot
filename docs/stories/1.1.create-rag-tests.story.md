# Story 1.1: Create Comprehensive RAG Test Suite

**Epic**: Epic 1 - LLM Feature Stabilization
**Story ID**: 1.1
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None

---

## Status

**Draft**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create thorough automated tests for the RAG system,
**so that** I can validate its correctness and establish performance baseline.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test file created: test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb
2. Tests cover document loading from all knowledge source types (MITRE ATT&CK, man pages, markdown)
3. Tests verify vector embedding generation and storage
4. Tests verify similarity search returns relevant results for sample queries
5. Tests validate RAG context formatting for LLM consumption
6. Edge cases tested: empty queries, no matches, large result sets
7. Test coverage >80% for rag/rag_manager.rb and related classes
8. All tests pass in Nix development environment

---

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Verify tests don't modify production knowledge bases
- **IV2**: Verify test execution time reasonable (<5 minutes for full suite)
- **IV3**: Verify tests can run offline (no external API dependencies for core functionality)

## Dev Notes

### RAG System Architecture

**RAG Manager** (`rag/rag_manager.rb`):
- Main coordinator for RAG operations
- Methods to test: `get_relevant_documents`, `add_documents`, `search`, context formatting
- [Source: docs/development/architecture.md#245-261]

**Vector DB Interface** (`rag/vector_db_interface.rb`):
- Abstract interface for vector database operations
- Implementations: ChromaDB (in-memory and server-based)
- [Source: Codebase inspection]

**Embedding Service Interface** (`rag/embedding_service_interface.rb`):
- Abstract interface for embedding generation
- Implementations: OpenAI, Ollama
- [Source: Codebase inspection]

### Existing Test Patterns

**Test Framework**: Ruby Minitest (based on existing tests)
[Source: test/test_helper.rb, test/test_llm_client_base.rb]

**Test File Pattern**:
```ruby
require_relative 'test_helper'

class TestRAGComprehensive < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    # Initialize test RAG manager
  end

  def teardown
    # Clean up test resources
  end

  def test_something
    # Test implementation
  end
end
```

**Test Execution**:
```bash
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb
# or
ruby test/run_tests.rb  # Run all tests
```
[Source: Existing test files]

### Test Configuration Example

```ruby
def setup
  @rag_config = {
    vector_db: {
      provider: 'chromadb',
      mode: 'in_memory'  # Isolated from production
    },
    embedding_service: {
      provider: 'ollama',
      model: 'nomic-embed-text'  # Small, fast model for testing
    },
    collection_name: 'test_rag_collection'  # Separate from production
  }

  @rag_manager = RAGManager.new(@rag_config)
end

def teardown
  @rag_manager.cleanup if @rag_manager
end
```

### Knowledge Source Test Data

**MITRE ATT&CK Sample**:
```ruby
# Small subset of techniques for testing
test_attack_data = [
  {
    id: 'T1003',
    name: 'Credential Dumping',
    description: 'Tools and techniques for dumping credentials...',
    metadata: { tactic: 'credential-access' }
  },
  # ... more test data
]
```

**Man Page Sample**:
```
LS(1)                     User Commands                    LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
...
```

**Markdown Sample**:
```markdown
# Lab 1: Port Scanning

## Objective
Learn to use nmap for network reconnaissance.

## Tools
- nmap
- netstat
...
```

### Performance Benchmarks

**Target Metrics** (from NFR4):
- Query response time: ≤ 5 seconds (excluding LLM inference)
- Document loading: ≤ 60 seconds for typical knowledge base
- Memory usage: ≤ 4GB for 1000+ documents

[Source: docs/prd.md#2.2 Non-Functional Requirements]

### Offline Testing

**CRITICAL**: Tests must pass without external network access

- Use Ollama for local embeddings (or mock embeddings)
- Use ChromaDB in-memory mode
- No OpenAI API calls in core tests
- Network tests should be optional/skipped in offline mode

[Source: docs/prd.md#2.3 CR4: Offline Operation Compatibility]

### Error Handling Pattern

```ruby
def test_error_scenario
  assert_raises(SomeError) do
    @rag_manager.method_that_should_fail
  end
end

def test_graceful_degradation
  result = @rag_manager.search_with_failures
  assert_nil result  # Should return nil, not crash
end
```

### Coverage Measurement

If using SimpleCov:
```ruby
# In test_helper.rb or top of test file
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start do
  add_filter '/test/'
  add_group 'RAG System', 'rag/'
end
```

## Testing

### Testing Strategy for This Story

**This IS the testing story** - we're creating tests, not testing tests.

**Validation Approach**:
1. **Manual Verification**: Run test suite, verify all pass
2. **Coverage Check**: Measure code coverage, verify >80%
3. **Performance Check**: Measure test execution time, verify <5 minutes
4. **Offline Check**: Run tests without network, verify pass

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run RAG comprehensive tests
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb

# Run with verbose output
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb --verbose

# Run in Nix environment
nix develop
ruby test/test_rag_comprehensive.rb

# Run all tests (optional)
ruby test/run_tests.rb
```

### Success Criteria

✅ All tests pass
✅ >80% code coverage on RAG manager
✅ Tests complete in <5 minutes
✅ Tests pass offline
✅ No production data modified
