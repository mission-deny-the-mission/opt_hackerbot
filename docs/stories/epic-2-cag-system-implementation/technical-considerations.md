# Technical Considerations

## Context Window Management
- **Target Context Size**: 32k-128k tokens depending on model capabilities
- **Document Chunking**: Semantic chunking with overlap preservation
- **Prioritization Strategy**: Relevance-based with cybersecurity domain weighting
- **Compression**: Lossless compression for text, lossy for less critical content

## Cache Optimization
- **Storage Format**: Binary KV cache with optional compression
- **Memory Mapping**: Efficient loading of large cache files
- **Incremental Updates**: Support for adding documents without full recompute
- **Versioning**: Cache versioning for compatibility and rollback

## Model Integration
- **Primary Models**: Long-context variants of existing LLM providers
- **Fallback**: Standard context models with reduced knowledge base
- **Optimization**: Model-specific tuning for cache efficiency
- **Compatibility**: Support for multiple model families

## Performance Monitoring
- **Metrics**: Query latency, cache hit rate, memory usage, context utilization
- **Profiling**: Detailed performance profiling for optimization
- **Alerting**: Performance degradation detection and alerting
- **Reporting**: Regular performance reports and trend analysis
