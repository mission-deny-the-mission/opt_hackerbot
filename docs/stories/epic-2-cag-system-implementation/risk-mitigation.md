# Risk Mitigation

## Primary Risks

**Risk 1: Context Window Limitations**
- **Impact**: High - May limit knowledge base size for CAG
- **Probability**: Medium - Context windows growing but still finite
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement intelligent document prioritization and chunking
  - Context compression techniques for large knowledge bases
  - Hybrid system with RAG fallback for large knowledge bases
  - Multiple cache configurations for different knowledge base sizes

**Risk 2: Cache Storage and Memory Requirements**
- **Impact**: Medium - May affect system scalability
- **Probability**: Medium - KV caches can be memory-intensive
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement efficient cache representation algorithms
  - Cache compression and optimization techniques
  - Configurable cache quality vs memory usage trade-offs
  - Cache eviction strategies for memory management

**Risk 3: Long-Context Model Availability**
- **Impact**: Medium - May limit model choices for CAG
- **Probability**: Low - Increasing availability of long-context models
- **Mitigation**:
  - Support for multiple long-context models (Ollama, OpenAI)
  - Fallback to smaller context windows with reduced knowledge base
  - Model-specific optimization strategies
  - Documentation of model requirements and limitations

**Risk 4: Cache Invalidation and Update Complexity**
- **Impact**: Medium - May affect knowledge base freshness
- **Probability**: Medium - Cache management complexity
- **Mitigation**:
  - Automated cache invalidation on knowledge base changes
  - Incremental cache update strategies
  - Versioned cache management
  - Clear cache refresh procedures and tools

**Risk 5: Integration Complexity with Existing RAG System**
- **Impact**: Medium - May destabilize existing functionality
- **Probability**: Low - Good architectural separation planned
- **Mitigation**:
  - Maintain complete RAG system independence
  - Thorough integration testing
  - Gradual rollout with fallback options
  - Comprehensive regression testing

## Rollback Plan

**If CAG implementation encounters blocking issues**:
1. Complete current story and document issues thoroughly
2. Maintain RAG system as primary knowledge enhancement method
3. Document CAG implementation status and blockers
4. Plan CAG as future enhancement opportunity

**If performance targets cannot be met**:
1. Document actual performance characteristics
2. Identify specific bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. Adjust performance targets based on realistic capabilities
4. Consider CAG for specific use cases where it excels

**If integration causes RAG system issues**:
1. Immediate rollback of CAG integration changes
2. Isolate CAG system until integration issues resolved
3. Comprehensive testing before reintegration attempt
4. Consider staggered integration approach
