# Notes

- This epic builds on the foundation established in Epic 1
- RAG system remains as fallback and for comparison purposes
- Focus on practical implementation for cybersecurity training use cases
- Consider long-context model availability and limitations
- Memory management and optimization are critical for success
- Performance validation should use same query set as Epic 1 for comparison
- Hybrid system approach provides flexibility for different use cases
- Documentation should enable easy adoption and configuration
