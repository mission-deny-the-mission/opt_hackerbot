# Compatibility Requirements

## Must Maintain
- ✅ All existing RAG functionality remains operational
- ✅ IRC bot framework compatibility unchanged
- ✅ LLM provider integrations (Ollama, OpenAI, VLLM, SGLang) maintained
- ✅ Offline operation capability preserved
- ✅ Existing configuration files continue to work
- ✅ Knowledge base loading from existing sources

## New Requirements
- ✅ Support for long-context LLM models (≥32k context window)
- ✅ Memory management for large context windows
- ✅ Cache storage and persistence capabilities
- ✅ Configuration for CAG vs RAG system selection
- ✅ Monitoring and debugging tools for CAG performance

## Performance Constraints
- ✅ Query latency: ≤2 seconds for CAG (target: 50-80% improvement over RAG)
- ✅ Memory usage: ≤6GB for typical knowledge bases with CAG
- ✅ Cache precomputation time: ≤5 minutes for typical knowledge base
- ✅ Cache loading time: ≤30 seconds from stored cache
- ✅ Test suite execution time: ≤10 minutes for CAG-specific tests
