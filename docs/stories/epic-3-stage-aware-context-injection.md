# Epic 3: Stage-Aware Context Injection

**Epic ID**: EPIC-3
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-01-XX
**Target Completion**: 2-3 weeks
**Related PRD**: [docs/prd.md](../prd.md)
**Depends on**: Epic 1 (RAG system validation and optimization complete), Epic 2I (Full IRC Channel Context Integration)

---

## Epic Goal

Enable per-attack explicit knowledge source selection through XML configuration, allowing attacks to pull in specific man pages, documents, and MITRE ATT&CK entries by identifier, providing precise and controllable context injection at each training stage.

---

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current Relevant Functionality**:
- IRC bot framework with progressive attack/training stages
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system - functional and deployed
- Attack progression system with stage tracking (`current_attack` index)
- Per-attack system prompts and configurations in XML
- Generic RAG context injection that applies the same context retrieval strategy regardless of attack stage
- Knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK, man pages, markdown files, lab sheets

**Technology Stack**:
- Language: Ruby 3.1+
- Development: Nix environment with local gem management
- Context Enhancement: rag/rag_manager.rb for knowledge retrieval
- Attack Management: bot_manager.rb handles attack progression and context assembly
- Configuration: XML-based bot configuration with `<attacks>` and `<attack>` elements

**Integration Points**:
- bot_manager.rb - Attack stage tracking and prompt assembly
- rag/rag_manager.rb - Knowledge context retrieval
- config/*.xml - Attack definitions and stage-specific configurations
- knowledge_bases/sources/ - Shared knowledge source loading

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Added/Changed**:

1. **Explicit Knowledge Source Selection**
   - Attack-level XML configuration for specifying exact knowledge items to include
   - Support for selecting specific man pages by name (e.g., "nmap", "netcat", "tcpdump")
   - Support for selecting specific documents by path/name (e.g., "attack-guide.md", "docs/pentest-primer.md")
   - Support for selecting specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques by ID (e.g., "T1003", "T1059.001", "T1078")

2. **Knowledge Item Retrieval System**
   - Man page lookup by command name from knowledge base
   - Document lookup by file path/name from knowledge base
   - MITRE ATT&CK technique lookup by technique ID
   - Direct knowledge retrieval that bypasses vector similarity search when specific items are requested

3. **XML Configuration Extensions**
   - `<context_config>` element within `<attack>` for explicit knowledge selection
   - `<man_pages>` sub-element with comma-separated or list of man page names
   - `<documents>` sub-element with comma-separated or list of document paths
   - `<mitre_techniques>` sub-element with comma-separated or list of MITRE technique IDs
   - Optional fallback to similarity-based retrieval if explicit items not found

4. **Context Assembly Logic**
   - Retrieve explicitly configured knowledge items for current attack stage
   - Combine user query with explicitly selected knowledge items
   - Format context with clear source attribution (man page name, document title, MITRE technique)
   - Support optional query-based augmentation in addition to explicit items

5. **Knowledge Source Integration**
   - Extend knowledge source managers to support identifier-based lookup
   - Man page knowledge source: lookup by command name
   - Markdown knowledge source: lookup by file path
   - MITRE ATT&CK knowledge: lookup by technique ID

**How It Integrates**:
- Extends bot_manager.rb `get_enhanced_context` to accept attack stage and parse attack-level context config
- Knowledge source managers enhanced with identifier-based lookup methods
- XML configuration parser extended to read `<context_config>` from attack definitions
- RAG system supports both explicit item retrieval and similarity-based fallback
- Maintains backward compatibility - existing bots without context config work unchanged
- Leverages existing knowledge base infrastructure (man pages, markdown, MITRE)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ XML configuration allows per-attack selection of specific man pages, documents, and MITRE techniques
- ✅ Explicitly configured knowledge items are retrieved and included in context
- ✅ Knowledge source managers support identifier-based lookup (name, path, technique ID)
- ✅ Fallback to similarity-based retrieval works when explicit items not found
- ✅ Context includes clear source attribution (which man page, which document, which technique)
- ✅ Existing bots without attack-level context configuration continue to work unchanged
- ✅ Configuration examples demonstrate usage patterns

## Stories

### Story 3.1: Add Identifier-Based Lookup to Knowledge Sources
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: None (Epic 1 completion recommended)

**Brief Description**: Extend knowledge source classes to support identifier-based lookup methods. Add methods to retrieve specific man pages by command name, specific documents by file path, and specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques by technique ID.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `ManPageKnowledgeSource` supports `get_man_page_by_name(command_name)` method
- [ ] `MarkdownKnowledgeSource` supports `get_document_by_path(file_path)` method
- [ ] `MITREAttackKnowledge` supports `get_technique_by_id(technique_id)` method
- [ ] Methods return structured data compatible with existing RAG document format
- [ ] Methods handle not found cases gracefully
- [ ] Unit tests verify lookup functionality for all three knowledge source types

---

### Story 3.2: XML Configuration for Explicit Knowledge Selection
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Story 3.1

**Brief Description**: Extend XML configuration schema to support attack-level explicit knowledge source selection. Allow `<attack>` elements to contain `<context_config>` with `<man_pages>`, `<documents>`, and `<mitre_techniques>` sub-elements for specifying exact items to include.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] XML schema supports optional `<context_config>` within `<attack>` elements
- [ ] `<man_pages>` element accepts comma-separated list or individual `<page>` elements (e.g., "nmap,netcat" or `<page>nmap</page><page>netcat</page>`)
- [ ] `<documents>` element accepts comma-separated list or individual `<doc>` elements (e.g., "attack-guide.md" or `<doc>attack-guide.md</doc>`)
- [ ] `<mitre_techniques>` element accepts comma-separated list or individual `<technique>` elements (e.g., "T1003,T1059" or `<technique>T1003</technique>`)
- [ ] Configuration parser reads and stores attack-level context settings in bot state
- [ ] Default behavior when no attack-level config specified (use existing RAG behavior)
- [ ] Configuration examples added to existing XML config files
- [ ] XML schema validation ensures valid context configuration

---

### Story 3.3: Implement Explicit Knowledge Retrieval in Context System
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days
**Dependencies**: Story 3.1, Story 3.2

**Brief Description**: Enhance `bot_manager.rb` and context retrieval system to use attack-level configuration for explicit knowledge item retrieval. When an attack has explicit knowledge configured, retrieve those specific items and include them in context instead of (or in addition to) similarity-based retrieval.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `get_enhanced_context` reads attack-level context configuration from bot state
- [ ] When man pages specified, retrieve them via `ManPageKnowledgeSource.get_man_page_by_name()`
- [ ] When documents specified, retrieve them via `MarkdownKnowledgeSource.get_document_by_path()`
- [ ] When MITRE techniques specified, retrieve them via `MITREAttackKnowledge.get_technique_by_id()`
- [ ] Explicitly retrieved items formatted and included in context
- [ ] Context includes clear source attribution (e.g., "Source: man page 'nmap'", "Source: MITRE ATT&CK T1003")
- [ ] Optional fallback: if explicit items not found, log warning but continue (or fall back to similarity search)
- [ ] Integration tests verify explicit knowledge retrieval during attack stages

---

### Story 3.4: Context Formatting and Assembly Enhancements
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Story 3.3

**Brief Description**: Enhance context formatting to clearly distinguish and organize explicitly selected knowledge items. Format context with clear sections for man pages, documents, and MITRE techniques, making it easy for LLM to utilize.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Context formatting groups explicit items by type (man pages, documents, MITRE)
- [ ] Each item includes clear source attribution
- [ ] Format is readable and well-structured for LLM consumption
- [ ] Option to combine explicit items with query-based similarity search (configurable)
- [ ] Context length management respects max_context_length limits
- [ ] Tests verify formatted context structure and completeness

---

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (optional parameters added)
- [x] XML configuration is backward compatible (new elements are optional)
- [x] Bots without attack-level context config use existing behavior
- [x] Performance impact is acceptable (efficient identifier lookups)
- [x] No breaking changes to bot_manager or RAG manager interfaces

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Over-complicating configuration with too many options
  - **Mitigation**: Keep XML configuration simple and intuitive; support both comma-separated lists and XML elements; provide clear examples
- **Primary Risk**: Performance degradation from identifier-based lookups
  - **Mitigation**: Efficient lookup implementation; avoid unnecessary database scans; use indexed lookups where possible
- **Primary Risk**: Context relevance regression for existing bots
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain strict backward compatibility; stage-aware features are opt-in via configuration
- **Rollback Plan**: Stage-aware features can be disabled via configuration; existing behavior is preserved as default

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing bot functionality verified through integration testing
- [ ] Stage-aware context demonstrates improved relevance in test scenarios
- [ ] XML configuration documented with examples
- [ ] No regression in existing features or performance
- [ ] Code coverage maintained for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated (configuration guide, architecture docs)

## Notes

This epic focuses on providing precise control over knowledge injection at each attack stage, allowing trainers to explicitly select which knowledge sources students have access to. This enables curriculum-driven learning where specific tools, documents, and attack techniques are introduced at appropriate stages. The implementation is designed to be opt-in and backward compatible, allowing gradual adoption across bot configurations.

Epic 2 (CAG System Implementation) has been shelved to prioritize this feature, which provides immediate value in curriculum control and precise knowledge delivery during training exercises. Note: Epic 2I (Full IRC Channel Context Integration) must be completed before this epic.
