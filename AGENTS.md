# Hackerbot Project Guide for AI Agents

## Project Overview

Hackerbot is a Ruby-based IRC bot framework for cybersecurity training exercises. It combines traditional attack simulation with modern AI capabilities through multiple LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI, VLLM, SGLang) and advanced knowledge retrieval systems (RAG + CAG).

**Development Environment**: This project uses a comprehensive Nix development environment that provides reproducible builds, automatic dependency management, and integrated IRC server functionality.

## Core Architecture

### Main Components
- `hackerbot.rb` - Entry point and CLI handler
- `bot_manager.rb` - Central bot instance controller
- `llm_client.rb` - Base LLM interface with provider-specific implementations
- `rag_cag_manager.rb` - Unified RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and CAG (Context-Aware Generation) coordinator

### Key Subsystems
1. **LLM Integration**: Multiple provider support with streaming and chat history
2. **RAG System**: Document retrieval and semantic search capabilities
3. **CAG System**: Entity extraction and knowledge graph analysis
4. **Knowledge Bases**: MITRE ATT&CK, man pages, markdown files
5. **Offline Support**: Persistent storage and air-gapped operation

## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure
```
opt_hackerbot/
├── rag/                # Retrieval-Augmented Generation
├── cag/                # Context-Aware Generation
├── knowledge_bases/    # Knowledge sources and processing
├── config/             # XML configuration files
├── docs/               # Documentation
└── test/               # Test suites
```

### Key Files to Know
- `config/example_*.xml` - Configuration examples and templates
- `setup_offline_rag_cag.rb` - Offline mode setup script
- `demo_*.rb` - Interactive demonstration scripts
- `knowledge_bases/mitre_attack_knowledge.rb` - Core threat intelligence
- `flake.nix` - Nix flake configuration for reproducible development environment
- `Makefile` - Development commands and shortcuts
- `simple_irc_server.py` - Custom Python IRC server implementation
- `Gemfile` - Ruby dependencies specification

### Configuration System
Bots are configured through XML files in `config/` with these key elements:
- `<llm_provider>` - Ollama, OpenAI, VLLM, or SGLang
- `<rag_cag_enabled>` - Enable/disable knowledge retrieval
- `<attacks>` - Progressive training scenarios
- `<knowledge_sources>` - Custom knowledge base configuration

### Development Tips
1. **LLM Clients**: Implement new providers by extending `llm_client.rb`
2. **Knowledge Sources**: Add new sources by extending `base_knowledge_source.rb`
3. **Configuration**: Use XML files for bot definitions and settings
4. **Testing**: Run tests with `ruby test/test_*.rb`
5. **Offline Mode**: Default operation mode, use `setup_offline_rag_cag.rb` for initial setup
6. **Nix Environment**: Always work within the Nix development environment for consistent dependencies
7. **IRC Server**: Use the built-in Python IRC server on port 6667 for testing

### Best Practices
- Keep LLM client implementations modular and provider-agnostic
- Use the factory pattern for creating LLM instances (`llm_client_factory.rb`)
- Implement proper error handling for external service connections
- Follow the existing naming conventions (snake_case for files and methods)
- Cache expensive operations (embedding generation, knowledge base queries)
- DO NOT commit or push using git WIHTOUT being asked to

### Important Notes
- System defaults to offline operation for security and reliability
- RAG and CAG can be controlled independently per bot
- MITRE ATT&CK framework is included by default in all knowledge bases
- Support for man pages and markdown files as additional knowledge sources

This framework provides flexible, offline-capable cybersecurity training with AI-powered conversations and comprehensive knowledge retrieval.

# BMAD-METHOD Agents and Tasks (OpenCode)

OpenCode reads AGENTS.md during initialization and uses it as part of its system prompt for the session. This section is auto-generated by BMAD-METHOD for OpenCode.

## How To Use With OpenCode

- Run `opencode` in this project. OpenCode will read `AGENTS.md` and your OpenCode config (opencode.json[c]).
- Reference a role naturally, e.g., "As dev, implement ..." or use commands defined in your BMAD tasks.
- Commit `.bmad-core` and `AGENTS.md` if you want teammates to share the same configuration.
- Refresh this section after BMAD updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i opencode`.

### Helpful Commands

- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`
- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate this section: `npx bmad-method install -f -i opencode`
- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`

Note
- Orchestrators run as mode: primary; other agents as all.
- All agents have tools enabled: write, edit, bash.
