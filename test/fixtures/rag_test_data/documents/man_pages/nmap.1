NAME
       nmap - Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

SYNOPSIS
       nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}

DESCRIPTION
       Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing.  Many
       systems and network administrators also find it useful for network
       inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
       service uptime.

OPTIONS
       -sS TCP SYN Stealth Scan
              This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning,
              because you don't open a full TCP connection.

       -sV Version detection
              Probe open ports to determine service/version info.

       -p port range
              Only scan specified ports Ex: -p22; -p1-65535; -p U:53,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080

       -O Enable OS detection
              Enable OS detection via TCP/IP fingerprinting.

       -A Aggressive scan options
              Enables OS detection (-O), version detection (-sV), script
              scanning (-sC) and traceroute (--traceroute).

EXAMPLES
       nmap -sS -O target.com
              Stealth SYN scan with OS detection
       nmap -sV -p 1-65535 target.com
              Full port range with version detection
