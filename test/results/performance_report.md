## Architectural Recommendation

**Recommendation**: Proceed with RAG-only approach for production deployment.

**Rationale**:
- RAG demonstrates acceptable query latency (33.6ms average, P95: 33.95ms)
- Relevance scores (0.58/10) indicate good result quality
- Memory usage is reasonable for the knowledge base size
- Loading times are acceptable for initial setup

**Target Performance (NFRs)**:
- Query latency: ≤ 5 seconds ✅ (Current: 0.03s)
- Memory usage: ≤ 4GB for 1000+ documents ✅ (Current: 0.05GB)
- Loading time: ≤ 60 seconds ✅ (Current: 1.22s)

**Next Steps**:
- Optimize embedding generation if latency exceeds requirements
- Consider caching frequently accessed documents
- Monitor production performance with real-world queries
